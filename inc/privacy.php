We value your privacy, here at AnonImg.<br><br>
In order to protect our users, <b>we do not log IP addresses upon uploading</b>.<br><br>
Upon illegal content being found uploaded before access logs are destroyed, we will make our best attempt find the uploader and ban them.<br><br>
We can <b>not legally prove</b> that this is the correct person due to the way the internet and webservers work, but it is assumed because of the uploader being the first GET request for the image. We have no way of knowing whether or not the correct user was found, and therefore we cannot persue legal action against the individual or provide evidence of their involvement.<br><br>
All EXIF data is cleared upon uploading and is <b>not</b> stored on our severs elsewhere. It is removed for convienence and privacy. The less we know about you, the better.<br><br>
Some competitors do in fact <b>log IP addresses upon upload</b> and <b>store them assosiated with images</b>, which is not acceptable. <br><br>
Stay safe.<br>
